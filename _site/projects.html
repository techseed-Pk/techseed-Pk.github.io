                                <h4>Klima Therm via Webmind</h4>
                                <div style="overflow-y: auto; max-height: 250px;">
                                    <p>Klima-Therm AB is a leading supplier of refrigeration products and heat pumps for both residential and commercial properties in the Swedish market, with brands such as Fujitsu, Fuji Electric, Clivet, Emicon, MTA, Kaisai, Klimor, and more in its portfolio.</p>

                                    <p>Klima-Therm's after-sales CRM existed but required fixes for several latency issues that had arisen due to the large amount of data accumulated over nearly a decade. It needed an overhaul, including migration to the latest .NET Core and database technologies, along with key architectural changes to make the system more scalable and adaptable.</p>

                                    <p>We estimated the recoding of the system in .NET Core and began addressing bottlenecks and latency issues, while also making key architectural improvements.</p>

                                    <p>We rebuilt the entire system, which comprised three major subsystems: the reseller website (running on an older version of Umbraco), the CRM, and the background services responsible for handling updates received from SAP.</p>

                                    <p>We also added new features, the most significant being the Thermal Need Calculator, which uses tens of parameters to calculate a household’s heat usage requirements and suggests the appropriate equipment available for purchase to meet those needs.</p>

                                    <p>We contributed to adding features and fixes for Igloo, one of the best starter themes available for Umbraco CMS. Moreover, we helped build several Umbraco plugins, most notably the Cision and MFN news feed plugins, which we use on several of our customers’ websites.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, we developed an Umbraco plugin to introduce a new DataGrid data editor in the admin dashboard, allowing admins to input stock information and customize how that information is presented on the site (in charts and tables).</p>

                                    <p>Hundreds of reports in digital format (i.e., PDF) were generated automatically, identifying the key influencers who shape their target audience's opinions.</p>

                                    <p>These reports provide insights into which individuals or sources are most influential within specific sectors and markets. By tracking these influencers and their impact on target demographics, PR and advertising teams can refine their strategies and stay ahead of shifting trends.</p>

                                    <p>We built the e-commerce store to handle the complete sales workflow, allowing customers to use credit cards and other payment methods to quickly purchase and download the reports.</p>

                                    <p>The reports were password-protected for users downloading them to prevent open distribution of these highly data-rich documents.</p>

                                    <p>Within two months of the launch, sales exceeded several thousand pounds, which was incredibly satisfying and encouraging.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">A backend service that received SMS messages from customers sent to designated short codes. Our system would process these messages and respond based on the type and format of the message received. For example, the system could subscribe a customer to receive live updates and results for FIFA World Cup matches on their mobile phones.</p>

                                    <p>We managed several different clients as a subcontractor for Vodafone Qatar, handling subscription services, including sending the appropriate content to customers based on their subscription type. Live football and cricket matches, as well as games played on TV shows, are just a few of the many events we managed through our system.</p>

                                    <p>We also provided Vodafone Qatar with tools to oversee all the requests and responses processed by our system and offered an efficient way to download reports and logs.</p>

                                    <p>We maintained the system to ensure excellence and continuous improvement, adding new features such as the reporting subsystem, which became an integral and frequently used component of the system.</p>

                                    <p>We successfully handled numerous live campaigns on behalf of Vodafone Qatar, reliably delivering content to subscribed customers. Additionally, we provided Vodafone with accurate reports to monitor all traffic and other key data points.</p>
